# Forecasting-the-Sales-with-the-implementation-of-time-series-models

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **weekly sales forecasting** using time-series models applied to an online retail dataset.  
The objective is to **compare multiple forecasting techniques** and identify the model that provides the most accurate predictions for retail sales.

The analysis evaluates model performance using:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Online Retail.xlsx  ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)
- **Data Type:** Transaction-level retail sales data  
- **Time Period:** December 2010 – November 2011  
- **Key Columns:** InvoiceDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, Country

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

### Data Cleaning
- Removed records where:
  - `Quantity ≤ 0`
  - `UnitPrice ≤ 0`
- Converted `InvoiceDate` to datetime format
- Excluded **December 2011** to avoid incomplete month bias

### Feature Engineering
- Created a new column:Sales = Quantity × UnitPrice
  
### Resampling
- Aggregated transactional data into **Weekly Sales** using: resample('W').sum()

These visualizations helped identify:
- Overall sales trend
- Country-level contribution
- High-demand products

## 🔀 Train-Test Split
- **Chronological split** to preserve time order
- Last **10 weeks** used as test data

### 1️⃣ Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt’s Method)
- Captures **trend** but ignores seasonality
- Suitable for data with a consistent upward or downward movement

### 2️⃣ Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
- Captures **trend + seasonality**
- Seasonal period set to **4 weeks**
<img width="1012" height="528" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4c011fa-f39a-4483-b793-59546dcfee1e" />

### 3️⃣ ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

#### Auto-ARIMA
- Used `pmdarima.auto_arima`
- Automatically selected optimal parameters using **AIC**
- Best model found: ARIMA(2,0,0)


#### Manual ARIMA (2,1,0)
- Manually tuned model
- Differencing (`d = 1`) applied to remove trend
- Provided the **best forecasting performance**
